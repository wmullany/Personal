Visitor IP Logging PHP Script

This PHP script (log.php) is designed to log visitor information when accessed via a web browser. It captures details such as IP address, user agent, request method, referring URL, and date/time of access.

Usage:
1. Place the log.php file on your web server.
2. Ensure that the web server has write permissions to create and append to the log file (log.txt).
3. Access the script via a web browser to log visitor information.

Security Considerations:
- Be extremely cautious about storing sensitive information such as IP addresses and user agents in log files. Implement appropriate data protection measures, such as encryption and access controls, to safeguard this information.
- Regularly monitor the log file for any suspicious activity, including unusual patterns of access or unauthorized access attempts.
- Ensure that the script is securely configured and accessible only to authorized users. Implement access controls, such as IP whitelisting or HTTP authentication, to restrict access to trusted users only.
- Consider implementing additional security measures, such as logging IP addresses only for specific purposes (e.g., security monitoring) and anonymizing or pseudonymizing sensitive information to protect user privacy.
- Keep the log.php script up to date with the latest security patches and best practices to mitigate known vulnerabilities and security risks.
